Welcome to the Pace-360!

Problem I am solving:

International students don’t have a prior knowledge about the campus which they want to get admission in. They can’t take a real time campus tour. This puts the student in dilemma to proceed further in admission process as to which campus to get enrolled in.

Idea/Solution

The solution is to provide the virtual tour of the university campuses and its labs. This helps the students to experience how it feels to be on campus and they will get a fair idea what to expect.
